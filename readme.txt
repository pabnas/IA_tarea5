To run the program just use the command  

phyton lab.py 

The program is set for 1000 episodes but you can change it in the line 31, wait for the agent to train and observe el solution that the agent found

Note:
if you want to know the rute of the agent in the line 88 put:
        gui.show_state(state, q_table,True)
